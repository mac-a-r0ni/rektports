# rektports
 things not on crux that I want on crux, or that I can't find elsewhere.

 PORTS:

 brightnessctl: sets screen brightness from the CLI.  
 elogind: systemd login agent ported from Slackware (untested).  
 hyprland: the fancy WM that everyone's been talking about, as seen on /r/unixporn.  
 hyprpaper: wallpaper manager for hyprland.  
 hyprpicker: color picker for hyprland, no idea why this even exists.  
 libdisplay-info: EDID and device info library.  
 libliftoff: KMS plane library.  
 pkg-clean: useful to CRUX repo maintainers, makes a clean system for package creation.  
 pkg-get: pre-build package installer/updater for CRUX, with underscore issue bugfixes.  
 xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland: XDG portal recommended for hyprland. (wlr also works, but screensharing won't).
